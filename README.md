Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG)
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique used to integrate data with AI models. In a RAG workflow, the first step involves loading data into a vector database, such as Redis. 
When a user query is received, the vector database retrieves a set of documents similar to the query. 
These docs then serve as the context for the user’s question and are used in conjunction with the user’s query to generate a response, typically through an AI model.
